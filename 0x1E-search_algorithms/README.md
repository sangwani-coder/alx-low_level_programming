# Search Algorithms
In this project I will be learning and about search algorithms and implementing them in the C language.
## General
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear seach
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
## Search Algorithm
A seach algorithm is an algorithm which solves a search problem. They work to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem, with either discrete or continous values.

## Tasks
* **0. Linear search**
[0-linear.c](./0-linear.c): Searches for a value in an array of integers using the linear search algorithm.
- prototype: **int linear\_search(int \*array, size_t, int value)**;
- Compiiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- The code should pass **Betty** style

* **1. Binary search**
[1-binary.c](./1-binary.c): Searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.
- prototype: **int binary\_search(int \*array, size_t, int value)**;
- Compiiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
