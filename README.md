# Low Level Programming & Algorithm
This repository contains projects where I learnt to program using the C programming language.

## C Programming language
The C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that directly interact with the hardware devices such as drives, kernels, etc.

C programming is considred as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is knnown as mother language.
